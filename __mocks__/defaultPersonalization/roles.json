  "Full Stack Engineer": "I recently worked with a team of 3 other engineers to construct the front end for an e-commerce website. We coordinated styling using CSS with styled components to build out separate micro-services using React to make our headless API come to life. I then proceeded to scale the back end of my teammateâ€™s microservice so it could handle a throughput of 70,000 rpm with < 1% error rate"
