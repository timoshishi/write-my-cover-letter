  "fullstack": "I recently worked with a team of 3 other engineers to construct the front end for an e-commerce website. We coordinated styling using CSS with styled components to build out separate micro-services using React to make our headless API come to life. I then proceeded to scale the back end of my teammateâ€™s microservice so it could handle a throughput of 70,000 rpm with < 1% error rate. I refashioned the API using PostgreSQL, optimized the queries with horizontal partitioning, deployed on AWS t.2 micro instances, and load-balanced with Nginx so I could verify that the front end could easily handle tens of millions of records. Working on your team, I will be able to quickly adapt to foreign code bases and provide my own clean code to improve both workflow and efficiency of any software I am exposed to."
